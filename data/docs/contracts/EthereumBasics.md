# Ethereum Basics

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform.

## Key Concepts

- **Accounts**: There are two types of accounts in Ethereum:
- Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs): Controlled by private keys
- Contract Accounts: Controlled by their code

- **Transactions**: Operations that change the state of the Ethereum blockchain
- From: Sender address
- To: Recipient address
- Value: Amount of ETH to transfer
- Data: Optional data payload
- Gas Limit: Maximum gas to use
- Gas Price: Price per unit of gas

- **Gas**: Unit that measures computational effort required to execute operations
- Gas Limit: Maximum amount of gas you're willing to use
- Gas Price: Amount of ETH you're willing to pay per unit of gas

- **Smart Contracts**: Programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain
- Self-executing with specific conditions written into code
- Automatically enforce agreements between parties

## Common Operations

- Sending ETH: Transfer value from one account to another
- Deploying Contracts: Upload contract code to the blockchain
- Calling Contract Functions: Interact with deployed contracts
